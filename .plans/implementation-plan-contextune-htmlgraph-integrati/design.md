id: task-0
priority: blocker
status: pending
dependencies: []
labels:
  - parallel-execution
  - auto-created
  - priority-blocker

# Create Shared Data Models Package

## 🎯 Objective

Create a `promptune-integration` package with shared Pydantic models for plans, tasks, and sessions that both Promptune and HtmlGraph can use, eliminating translation layers.

## 🛠️ Implementation Approach

**Pattern to follow:**
- **File:** `htmlgraph/models.py:1-100`
- **Description:** Use Pydantic BaseModel pattern with validation

**Libraries:**
- `pydantic>=2.0` - Shared models with validation
- `pyyaml>=6.0` - YAML serialization

## 📁 Files to Touch

**Create:**
- `promptune_integration/__init__.py`
- `promptune_integration/models.py` - Shared Plan, Task, Session models
- `promptune_integration/converters.py` - Convert between formats
- `tests/test_models.py` - Model validation tests
- `pyproject.toml` - Package configuration

**Modify:**
- `promptune/pyproject.toml` - Add dependency on integration package
- `htmlgraph/pyproject.toml` - Add dependency on integration package

## 🧪 Tests Required

**Unit:**
- [ ] Test Plan model validation
- [ ] Test Task model validation
- [ ] Test Session model validation
- [ ] Test YAML serialization/deserialization
- [ ] Test converters from Promptune → Integration
- [ ] Test converters from Integration → HtmlGraph

**Integration:**
- [ ] Test end-to-end Plan creation flow
- [ ] Test model compatibility with both systems

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All models use Pydantic BaseModel
- [ ] Models serialize to/from YAML correctly
- [ ] Converters handle all edge cases
- [ ] 100% test coverage on models
- [ ] Documentation for each model field
- [ ] Type hints on all functions
- [ ] Published to PyPI as `promptune-integration`

## ⚠️ Potential Conflicts

**Files:**
- None - This is a new package

## 📝 Notes

This is a blocker because all other tasks depend on shared models.
Package should be minimal and focused - only data models, no business logic.

# Implement Auto-Tracking Hook

## 🎯 Objective

Create hooks in Promptune that automatically create HtmlGraph tracks when running `/ctx:plan` and automatically start features when running `/ctx:execute`.

## 🛠️ Implementation Approach

**Pattern to follow:**
- **File:** `hooks/user_prompt_submit.py:1-200`
- **Description:** Hook pattern with JSON input/output

**Libraries:**
- `htmlgraph>=0.7.5` - SDK for track/feature creation
- `promptune-integration>=0.1.0` - Shared models

## 📁 Files to Touch

**Create:**
- `hooks/promptune_htmlgraph_bridge.py` - Auto-tracking hook
- `tests/test_integration_hook.py` - Hook tests

**Modify:**
- `hooks/hooks.json` - Register new PreToolUse hook
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` - Update dependencies

## 🧪 Tests Required

**Unit:**
- [ ] Test track creation from plan data
- [ ] Test feature start from execute command
- [ ] Test hook response format
- [ ] Test error handling when HtmlGraph unavailable

**Integration:**
- [ ] Test full /ctx:plan → HtmlGraph track flow
- [ ] Test full /ctx:execute → HtmlGraph feature flow
- [ ] Test with actual HtmlGraph installation

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Running `/ctx:plan` creates HtmlGraph track automatically
- [ ] Running `/ctx:execute` starts HtmlGraph features automatically
- [ ] Hook doesn't block if HtmlGraph unavailable
- [ ] All activity logged to HtmlGraph session
- [ ] Track ID stored in plan metadata
- [ ] Feature IDs stored in task metadata
- [ ] Backward compatible (works without HtmlGraph)

## ⚠️ Potential Conflicts

**Files:**
- `hooks/hooks.json` - Task 2 also modifies → Use different hook points

## 📝 Notes

Hook should be non-blocking - if HtmlGraph SDK fails, just log warning
and continue. This maintains Promptune's standalone usability.

# Create Unified Configuration

## 🎯 Objective

Create a unified configuration system that both Promptune and HtmlGraph can read from a single `.promptune-config.yaml` file.

## 🛠️ Implementation Approach

**Libraries:**
- `pyyaml>=6.0` - Configuration parsing
- `pydantic>=2.0` - Config validation

- `htmlgraph/config.py` - Use unified config loader

## 🧪 Tests Required

**Unit:**
- [ ] Test config loading from YAML
- [ ] Test config validation with Pydantic
- [ ] Test fallback to defaults
- [ ] Test environment variable overrides

**Integration:**
- [ ] Test Promptune reads config correctly
- [ ] Test HtmlGraph reads config correctly
- [ ] Test config changes reflected in both systems

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Single `.promptune-config.yaml` works for both projects
- [ ] Config validates with Pydantic schema
- [ ] Environment variables override file values
- [ ] Backward compatible with existing configs
- [ ] Clear error messages for invalid config
- [ ] Documentation with examples
- [ ] Default config doesn't require file

## ⚠️ Potential Conflicts

**Files:**
- None - Config files are read-only

## 📝 Notes

Config should support hierarchical loading:
1. Default values (in code)
2. Global config (~/.promptune-config.yaml)
3. Project config (./.promptune-config.yaml)
4. Environment variables

- [ ] Displays intent detection accuracy metrics
- [ ] Shows parallel execution status
- [ ] Visualizes token savings from optimizations
- [ ] Works with `htmlgraph serve` command
- [ ] Gracefully handles missing Promptune data

## ⚠️ Potential Conflicts

**Files:**
- `htmlgraph/dashboard.py` - Only adds new tab, minimal conflict risk

## 📝 Notes

Dashboard should show:
- Recent Promptune commands (/ctx:plan, /ctx:execute, etc.)
- Intent detection: queries → commands mapping
- Token savings metrics
- Parallel execution timeline
- Hook execution times

## 📁 Files to Touch

**Create:**
- `docs/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Complete integration guide
- `docs/UNIFIED_WORKFLOW.md` - Workflow documentation
- `docs/MIGRATION.md` - Migration from standalone to integrated
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE_DECISION.md` - Why layered integration

**Modify:**
- `README.md` - Add integration section
- `docs/QUICKSTART.md` - Update for unified workflow

## 🧪 Tests Required

**Unit:**
- [ ] Verify all code examples work
- [ ] Check all links resolve
- [ ] Validate YAML examples

**Integration:**
- [ ] Test quick start guide end-to-end
- [ ] Verify migration steps work

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Integration guide covers all features
- [ ] Workflow documentation with examples
- [ ] Migration guide for existing users

📋 Plan created in extraction-optimized format!

**Plan Summary:**
- 5 total tasks
- 3 can run in parallel (task-0, task-2, and task-4 after dependencies)
- 2 have dependencies (task-1 depends on task-0, task-3 depends on task-1)
- Conflict risk: Low

**Tasks by Priority:**
- Blocker: task-0 (shared models)
- High: task-1 (auto-tracking), task-2 (unified config)
- Medium: task-3 (dashboard views)
- Low: task-4 (documentation)

**What Happens Next:**

The plan above will be automatically extracted to modular files when you:
1. Run `/ctx:execute` - Extracts and executes immediately
2. End this session - SessionEnd hook extracts automatically

**Extraction Output:**
```
.parallel/plans/
├── plan.yaml           (main plan with metadata)
├── tasks/
│   ├── task-0.md      (GitHub-ready task files)
│   ├── task-1.md
│   ├── task-2.md
│   ├── task-3.md
│   └── task-4.md
├── templates/
│   └── task-template.md
└── scripts/
    ├── add_task.sh
    └── generate_full.sh
```

**Key Benefits:**
✅ **Full visibility**: You see complete plan in conversation
✅ **Easy iteration**: Ask for changes before extraction
✅ **Zero manual work**: Extraction happens automatically
✅ **Modular files**: Edit individual tasks after extraction
✅ **Perfect DRY**: Plan exists once (conversation), extracted once (files)

**Next Steps:**
1. Review the plan above (scroll up if needed)
2. Request changes if needed
3. When satisfied, run: `/ctx:execute`

Ready to execute? Run `/ctx:execute` to extract and start parallel development.
