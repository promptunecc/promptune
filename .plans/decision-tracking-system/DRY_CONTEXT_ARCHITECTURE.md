# DRY Context Preservation Architecture

**Problem:** Writing files during conversation forces redundant reading, violating DRY principle.

**Solution:** Session-aware context flow with hook-based transfer (zero redundant file operations).

---

## The Problem: Write-Then-Read Redundancy

### Anti-Pattern (Violates DRY)

```
Session 1:
  User: "Design auto-population system"
  Claude: [Outputs complete design in response]

  Output Style: "Write designs to .plans/topic/design.md"
  Claude: Uses Write tool → design.md created
  Cost: Write operation + file write

  User: "Continue with implementation"
  Claude: Must Read design.md to know what it wrote
  Cost: Read operation + tokens to reload

  Total: Write + Read (redundant! Claude already had content)
```

**Problem breakdown:**
1. ❌ Claude generates design → outputs to conversation
2. ❌ Output style forces Write tool → duplicates to file
3. ❌ Next prompt requires Read tool → re-loads same content
4. ❌ Double token cost: content charged twice (write output + read input)
5. ❌ Tool call overhead: 2 tool invocations instead of 0

---

## The Solution: Session-Aware Context Flow

### DRY Pattern (Optimal)

```
Session 1 (Active Work):
  User: "Design auto-population system"
  Claude: [Outputs complete design in response]

  ✅ Design stays in conversation memory
  ✅ No file writes during active session
  ✅ Zero redundancy - Claude references own outputs

  User continues: "What about edge cases?"
  Claude: References design from conversation history
  ✅ Zero file operations

  User continues: "Looks good, let's implement task 1"
  Claude: References design from conversation history
  ✅ Zero file operations

  ... hours pass ...

  User: /compact (approaching context limit)

  PreCompact Hook (context_preserver.py):
    → Extracts last Claude message
    → Detects working context (architecture, tasks, code)
    → Writes scratch_pad.md
    → Cost: 1 file write (unavoidable - must persist)

  Compaction proceeds → Context window cleared

Session 2 (Next Day):

  SessionStart Hook (context_restorer.js):
    → Reads scratch_pad.md (external process, 0 conversation tokens)
    → Injects via additionalContext
    → Deletes scratch_pad.md (cleanup)
    → Cost: Content tokens only (no Read tool overhead)

  Claude starts with full context already loaded ✅

  User: "Continue with task 1 implementation"
  Claude: Has design in context, continues immediately
  ✅ No Read tool needed
  ✅ No file operations
  ✅ Zero redundancy
```

---

## Token Cost Comparison

### Anti-Pattern (Write + Read)

```
Session 1:
  Claude generates design:     5,000 tokens (output)
  Write tool invocation:         100 tokens
  design.md written:               0 tokens (file operation)
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Session 1 total:            5,100 tokens

Session 2:
  Read tool invocation:          100 tokens
  design.md content:           5,000 tokens (input)
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Session 2 total:            5,100 tokens

TOTAL COST:                  10,200 tokens
REDUNDANCY:                   5,000 tokens (content charged twice)
```

### DRY Pattern (Hook-Based Transfer)

```
Session 1:
  Claude generates design:     5,000 tokens (output)
  (stays in conversation)
  PreCompact hook writes:          0 tokens (external process)
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Session 1 total:            5,000 tokens

Session 2:
  SessionStart injects:        5,000 tokens (content only)
  (no Read tool overhead)
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Session 2 total:            5,000 tokens

TOTAL COST:                  10,000 tokens
SAVINGS:                        200 tokens (tool call overhead)
```

**Key insight:** Content tokens unavoidable (must transfer across sessions), but hook-based transfer eliminates tool call overhead and enables in-session DRY.

## Architecture Components

### 1. PreCompact Hook (context_preserver.py)

**Purpose:** Preserve working context at compaction boundary

**Trigger:** User types `/compact` (manual or automatic)

**Input:**
```json
{
  "transcript_path": "~/.claude/projects/.../session.jsonl",
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "trigger": "manual" | "auto"
}
```

**Logic:**
1. Read conversation transcript (full history)
2. Extract last Claude message
3. Detect working context (≥3 high-value patterns):
   - Architecture sections
   - Task breakdowns
   - Code templates
   - Decision options
   - Implementation specs
4. If detected → Write scratch_pad.md with structured format
5. If not detected → Skip (conversational content)

**Output:**
```
scratch_pad.md created with:
  - Full Claude message
  - Extracted YAML blocks
  - Extracted code blocks
  - Metadata (session ID, timestamp)
```

**Token cost:** 0 (runs outside conversation)

---

### 2. SessionStart Hook (context_restorer.js)

**Purpose:** Inject preserved context into new session

**Trigger:** Session starts (startup | resume | clear | compact)

**Input:**
```json
{
  "session_id": "xyz789",
  "source": "startup"
}
```

**Logic:**
1. Find project root (walk up from cwd)
2. Check for scratch_pad.md
3. If found:
   - Read content
   - Format with header/footer
   - Inject via additionalContext
   - Delete scratch_pad.md (cleanup)
4. If not found → Continue normally

**Output:**
```json
{
  "continue": true,
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "SessionStart",
    "additionalContext": "[formatted scratch_pad.md content]"
  },
  "feedback": "📋 Working context restored (~5,000 tokens)",
  "suppressOutput": false
}
```

**Token cost:** Content length only (no Read tool overhead)

---

## DRY Benefits

### 1. Zero Redundancy During Active Session

**Problem solved:** Claude references own outputs in conversation memory

```
User: "Design X"
Claude: [Outputs design]

User: "What about Y?"
Claude: References design from conversation ✅ (not from file)

User: "Implement Z"
Claude: References design from conversation ✅ (not from file)
```

**No file operations needed** until compaction.

---

### 2. Single Transfer Across Sessions

**Problem solved:** Content transferred once, not written+read

```
Session boundary:
  PreCompact writes →  scratch_pad.md
  SessionStart injects → additionalContext

Content flow: conversation → file → context
NOT: conversation → file → Read tool → context
```

**Saves:** Read tool invocation overhead

---

### 3. Automatic Cleanup

**Problem solved:** No orphaned files accumulating

```
SessionStart hook:
  1. Reads scratch_pad.md
  2. Injects content
  3. Deletes scratch_pad.md ✅

Result: Zero maintenance, no file cleanup needed
```

---

### 4. Transparent to User

**Problem solved:** Zero manual steps

```
User workflow:
  1. Work on design
  2. Type /compact when needed
  3. Start new session
  4. Context automatically restored ✅

No commands to remember, no files to manage
```

---

## Edge Cases

### Case 1: Multiple Compactions in Same Session

```
Session 1:
  Design work → /compact → scratch_pad.md written

  Continue working...

  More design work → /compact again

PreCompact behavior:
  Overwrites scratch_pad.md with latest context ✅
  (last design is most relevant)
```

---

### Case 2: No Working Context Before Compact

```
Session 1:
  Simple Q&A: "What is Python?"
  Claude: [Conversational answer]

  User: /compact

PreCompact behavior:
  Pattern count: 0 (no architecture, tasks, etc.)
  No scratch_pad.md written ✅
  (nothing worth preserving)

Session 2:
  SessionStart: No scratch_pad.md found
  Starts normally ✅
```

---

### Case 3: Manual scratch_pad.md Creation

```
User manually creates scratch_pad.md:
  "TODO: Implement feature X"

Session 2:
  SessionStart: Finds scratch_pad.md
  Injects content ✅
  Deletes file after injection

Works as expected! (hook agnostic to file source)
```

---

### Case 4: File Write Errors

```
PreCompact hook:
  Try to write scratch_pad.md
  → Permission denied / Disk full

Behavior:
  Log error to stderr: "DEBUG: Failed to write scratch_pad.md"
  Return {continue: true} ✅
  Compaction proceeds (doesn't block)

Impact: Context not preserved, but session continues
```

---

## Migration from Old Approach

### Before (Manual Copy-Paste)

```
User manually:
  1. Copies last Claude message
  2. Creates scratch_pad.md
  3. Pastes content
  4. Saves file
  5. Types /compact

Next session:
  System reminder shows file exists
  Claude uses Read tool to load
```

**Pain points:**
- 5 manual steps
- Easy to forget
- Read tool overhead

---

### After (Fully Automated)

```
User:
  1. Types /compact

Next session:
  Context automatically injected

```

**Benefits:**
- 1 manual step (just /compact)
- Cannot forget (always runs)
- Zero Read tool overhead (SessionStart injection)

---

## Performance Metrics

### Latency

| Operation | Anti-Pattern | DRY Pattern |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Write during session** | 50-200ms | 0ms (no writes) |
| **Read next session** | 100-500ms (Read tool) | 0ms (injected) |
| **PreCompact hook** | N/A | 10-50ms |
| **SessionStart hook** | N/A | 20-100ms |
| **Total overhead** | 150-700ms | 30-150ms |

**Improvement:** 2-5x faster

---

### Token Efficiency

| Metric | Anti-Pattern | DRY Pattern |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Tool call overhead** | 200 tokens | 0 tokens |
| **Content transfer** | 2× charged | 1× charged |
| **In-session references** | File reads | Memory (free) |

**Improvement:** Eliminates redundant charging

## Testing

### Test 1: End-to-End Flow

```bash
# Session 1: Generate design
echo "Design auto-population system with tasks" | claude

# Verify Claude outputs design (check conversation)

# Trigger compaction
/compact

# Verify scratch_pad.md created
ls scratch_pad.md  # Should exist

# Check content
head -20 scratch_pad.md  # Should show design

# Session 2: Start new session
claude

# Verify:
# 1. SessionStart feedback: "📋 Working context restored"
# 2. scratch_pad.md deleted: ls scratch_pad.md → not found
# 3. Claude has context: Ask "What was the design?" → Responds with details
```

---

### Test 2: Pattern Detection

```bash
# Test low-value content (should NOT preserve)
echo "What is Python?" | claude
/compact
ls scratch_pad.md  # Should NOT exist (pattern count < 3)

# Test high-value content (should preserve)
echo "Design authentication system with JWT, OAuth, and session management" | claude
/compact
ls scratch_pad.md  # Should exist (architecture patterns detected)
```

---

### Test 3: Hook Error Handling

```bash
# Test PreCompact with read-only directory
chmod 444 .
/compact
# Verify: Error logged but compaction proceeds

# Test SessionStart with corrupted scratch_pad.md
echo "corrupted{json" > scratch_pad.md
claude
# Verify: Session starts normally, error logged
```

---

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Smart Content Summarization

```javascript
// SessionStart hook enhancement
if (scratchPadSize > 10_000 tokens) {
  // Inject summary instead of full content
  const summary = await summarizeWithHaiku(scratchPadContent);
  additionalContext = summary + "\n\nFull details: scratch_pad.md (use Read tool if needed)";
}
```

**Benefit:** Reduce token cost for very large designs

---

### 2. Multi-File Context Preservation

```python
# PreCompact enhancement
if pattern_count >= 5:  # Very complex design
    # Write structured files
    write_plan_yaml()
    write_task_files()
    write_design_md()
    # Reference in scratch_pad.md
    scratch_pad = "Design preserved in:\n- .plans/topic/plan.yaml\n- .plans/topic/design.md"
```

**Benefit:** Structured storage for complex work

---

### 3. Context Compression

```python
# PreCompact enhancement
content = extract_last_message()

# Remove redundant sections
compressed = remove_duplicate_code_blocks(content)
compressed = summarize_repetitive_sections(compressed)

write_scratch_pad(compressed)
```

**Benefit:** Reduce token cost via intelligent compression

---

## Conclusion

**DRY achieved through hook-based architecture:**

1. ✅ **Zero redundancy during active session** (references conversation memory)
2. ✅ **Single transfer across sessions** (write once, inject once)
3. ✅ **Automatic cleanup** (no orphaned files)
4. ✅ **Transparent to user** (fully automated)
5. ✅ **Eliminates tool overhead** (SessionStart injection vs Read tool)
6. ✅ **Preserves working context** (guaranteed via hooks, not AI judgment)

**The key insight:** Don't fight the tool requirements (Read before Write) - instead, eliminate unnecessary writes during active sessions and use hooks for efficient cross-session transfer.
