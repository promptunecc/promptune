# /ctx:improve - Feature Improvement Command (Concept)

**Status:** Proposal / Concept
**Purpose:** Systematic feature improvement management
**Different from:** /ctx:plan (new features) vs /ctx:improve (existing improvements)

---

## Executive Summary

**/ctx:improve** is a proposed Promptune command for managing continuous improvement opportunities. It differs from `/ctx:plan` by focusing on **existing** improvement opportunities (from release notes, tech debt, bugs) rather than new feature development.

**Value Proposition:**
- Track improvements systematically (not ad-hoc)
- Prioritize by impact vs effort
- Execute efficiently (parallel when possible)
- Measure value delivered

---

## Problem Statement

**Current State:**
- Improvement opportunities identified ad-hoc
- No systematic tracking
- No prioritization framework
- Dependencies unclear
- Value not measured

**Example Pain Points:**
1. Release notes have new features → "We should use that!"
2. Months later: "Did we ever implement X?"
3. Start implementing → blocked by dependency we didn't know about
4. Can't measure ROI of improvements

**Gap:** Need systematic improvement management, not just feature planning.

---

## Solution: /ctx:improve Command

### Core Workflow

```
1. ANALYZE    → Scan sources (release notes, issues, tech debt)
2. CATALOG    → Add to features.yaml with metadata
3. PRIORITIZE → Score by (impact / effort) * risk
4. EXECUTE    → Create worktrees, track status
5. MEASURE    → Track value delivered
```

### Comparison to /ctx:plan

| Aspect | /ctx:plan | /ctx:improve |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| **Purpose** | Plan NEW features | Track EXISTING improvements |
| **Source** | User request | External changes (releases, bugs, debt) |
| **Timeline** | Immediate (sprint) | Backlog (prioritized queue) |
| **Research** | Always (5 agents) | Sometimes (depends) |
| **Format** | Modular YAML + tasks | Feature catalog (features.yaml) |
| **Execution** | Parallel worktrees | Parallel + sequential (dependencies) |
| **Lifecycle** | Plan → Execute → Complete | Identify → Prioritize → Track → Execute |

**Key Insight:** Complementary, not overlapping!

## Command Specification

### /ctx:improve analyze

**Purpose:** Analyze sources for improvement opportunities.

**Usage:**
```bash
/ctx:improve analyze --source FILE [--category CATEGORY]

Examples:
  /ctx:improve analyze --source release-notes.md
  /ctx:improve analyze --source github-issues.json --category bugs
  /ctx:improve analyze --source tech-debt.md
```

**What it does:**
1. Reads source document
2. Uses Haiku to identify improvements
3. Extracts:
   - What changed
   - Why it's valuable
   - How to implement
   - Dependencies
4. Adds to features.yaml
5. Assigns priority based on impact

**Output:**
```
✅ Analyzed release-notes.md

Found 8 new improvement opportunities:
  🔥 feat-016: Haiku 4.5 Integration (critical)
  ⭐ feat-017: AskUserQuestion tool (high)
  ○ feat-018: PreToolUse modifications (medium)
  ...

Added to features.yaml
Run: /ctx:improve list to see all features
```

## Integration Points

### With /ctx:plan

```bash
# Workflow: Improvement → Plan → Execute

# 1. Identify improvement
/ctx:improve analyze --source release-notes.md
# Adds: feat-020 (complex feature)

# 2. See it's complex
/ctx:improve list
# Shows: feat-020 (complexity: high, risk: medium)

# 3. Use ctx:plan for detailed planning
/ctx:plan
# "Implement feat-020: [detailed requirements]"
# Creates: .parallel/plans/ with research

# 4. Execute via ctx:execute
/ctx:execute
# Uses plan from /ctx:plan

# 5. Mark improvement complete
/ctx:improve complete feat-020
```

**Complementary:**
- **/ctx:improve:** Identify & prioritize
- **/ctx:plan:** Detailed planning for complex features
- **/ctx:execute:** Parallel execution

### With /ctx:research

```bash
# Some improvements need research first

# 1. Identify improvement
/ctx:improve analyze --source issues.json
# Adds: feat-021 (research needed)

# 2. Research first
/ctx:research --topic "Best practices for X"
# Returns: Research findings

# 3. Update improvement with findings
/ctx:improve update feat-021 --research "..."

# 4. Execute
/ctx:improve execute feat-021
```

### With Existing Scripts

```bash
# Behind the scenes, /ctx:improve uses:

/ctx:improve list
  → ./scripts/feature-status.sh

/ctx:improve graph
  → ./scripts/feature-graph.sh

/ctx:improve execute feat-001
  → ./scripts/feature-execute.sh feat-001

/ctx:improve complete feat-001
  → ./scripts/feature-complete.sh feat-001
```

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Release Notes Analysis

**Scenario:** Claude Code releases v2.1.0 with 10 new features.

**Workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Download release notes
curl -o release-notes-v2.1.0.md https://...

# 2. Analyze
/ctx:improve analyze --source release-notes-v2.1.0.md

# Output:
#   Found 6 improvement opportunities:
#     feat-025: New feature X (critical)
#     feat-026: Enhanced feature Y (high)
#     ...

# 3. Review and prioritize
/ctx:improve list --priority critical

# 4. Execute high-value improvements
/ctx:improve execute-batch --priority critical
```

---

### Use Case 2: Technical Debt Management

**Scenario:** Accumulated technical debt across codebase.

**Workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Document tech debt
cat > tech-debt.md <<EOF
# Technical Debt

1. Old API still using callbacks (should use promises)
2. Duplicate code in 3 files (should extract)
3. Missing tests for edge cases
EOF

# 2. Analyze
/ctx:improve analyze --source tech-debt.md --category tech-debt

# 3. Prioritize by effort
/ctx:improve list --sort-by effort_to_value

# 4. Execute quick wins first
/ctx:improve execute feat-030  # Low effort, high value
```

---

### Use Case 3: Bug Backlog

**Scenario:** 50 bugs in GitHub issues.

**Workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Export bugs
gh issue list --label bug --json title,body > bugs.json

# 2. Analyze
/ctx:improve analyze --source bugs.json --category bugs

# 3. Prioritize by severity
/ctx:improve list --category bugs --sort-by priority

# 4. Execute in parallel
/ctx:improve execute-batch --category bugs --priority critical
```

## FAQ

### Q: How is this different from /ctx:plan?

**A:** /ctx:plan is for planning NEW features from scratch. /ctx:improve is for tracking EXISTING improvement opportunities. They complement each other:

- `/ctx:improve` identifies what should be improved
- `/ctx:plan` plans how to build complex features
- `/ctx:execute` executes the plans

### Q: Can I use this for new features too?

**A:** Yes, but /ctx:plan is better for new features because it includes comprehensive research (5 parallel agents). Use /ctx:improve for improvements where requirements are clear.

### Q: How does dependency tracking work?

**A:** Features declare dependencies in features.yaml. The system prevents execution of features until dependencies are completed. This prevents wasted work.

### Q: Can I customize the prioritization formula?

**A:** Yes! Edit features.yaml to adjust impact/effort scores. The priority_score is calculated as: `(impact_score / effort_score) * risk_multiplier`

### Q: Does this work offline?

**A:** Yes! All tracking is in features.yaml (local file). Analysis phase needs network (uses Haiku), but execution/tracking works offline.

---

## Conclusion

**/ctx:improve** fills a gap between feature planning (/ctx:plan) and execution (/ctx:execute) by providing systematic improvement management.

**Key Value:**
1. **Track improvements** systematically (not ad-hoc)
2. **Prioritize** by impact vs effort
3. **Execute efficiently** (parallel when possible)
4. **Measure value** delivered

**Status:** Foundation complete (scripts + features.yaml). Command implementation next.

**Ready to build:** Yes!
