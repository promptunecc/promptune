## The Problem

Claude Code has 80+ plugins with hundreds of slash commands. You can't remember them all.

**Before Promptune:**

```
You: "I need to run tests"
Claude: "Sure! Running tests..."
[30 seconds later, writes custom test script]
```

**After Promptune:**

```
You: "I need to run tests"
Promptune: 🎯 Auto-executing /sc:test (85% confidence, keyword match, 0.02ms)
Claude: [Executes /sc:test automatically]
```

## 🚀 NEW in v0.9.0: Context Engineering Framework

**Complete context optimization with session duration tracking, usage monitoring, and smart tool routing**

Promptune v0.9.0 introduces comprehensive context engineering features that maximize session duration and minimize costs.

### 📊 Session Duration Tracking (NEW)

**Measure context preservation effectiveness**:

```bash
# View session metrics
./scripts/view_session_metrics.sh

# Example output:
Session: session_1730000000
Started: 2025-10-26 21:00:00
First Compact: 2025-10-26 21:28:00
Duration: 28.0 minutes
Status: ✅ Good context preservation
```

**Thresholds**:

- ⚠️ Short (<10 min): Needs optimization
- ✅ Good (10-30 min): Healthy usage
- 🎯 Excellent (30+ min): Excellent preservation

### 💰 Usage Monitoring & Optimization (v0.8.9)

**Automatic cost optimization based on quota consumption**:

- **At 90% weekly usage**: Auto-switch to Haiku (87% savings)
- **Parallel task limits**: 2 concurrent at high usage
- **Three-tier fallback**: Headless → Estimation → Manual paste

**Track usage**:

```bash
/usage                # Claude Code's usage command
/promptune:usage     # Paste output to track in Promptune
```

### ⚡ Smart Tool Routing (v0.9.0)

**Intelligent delegation of expensive operations**:

- Read >1000 lines → Delegate to Haiku
- Complex Bash → Delegate to Haiku
- Fast operations → Keep on Sonnet

**Cost savings**: 77-87% per delegated operation
**Context benefit**: 3x longer sessions before compaction

---

## 🚀 v0.3.0: Haiku Agent Architecture

**81% cost reduction + 2x speedup with three-tier intelligence**

Promptune v0.3.0 introduces cost-optimized Haiku agents that dramatically reduce parallel workflow costs while improving performance.

## Features

### 🚀 **3-Tier Detection Cascade**

- **Keyword Matching** (0.02ms) - 60% of queries
- **Model2Vec Embeddings** (0.2ms) - 30% of queries
- **Semantic Router** (50ms) - 10% of queries

### 🤖 **Haiku-Powered Interactive Analysis** (NEW in v0.9.0)

Uses Claude Code headless mode with Haiku to provide intelligent command suggestions:

- **Fast analysis**: 1-2 seconds for comprehensive prompt evaluation
- **Smart alternatives**: Suggests better commands when initial match isn't optimal
- **No API key needed**: Uses your existing Claude Code authentication
- **Context-aware**: Understands your workflow and suggests command sequences

**Example:**

```
You: "can you help me research the best React state libraries"
Detected: /ctx:help (100% via fuzzy, 0.64ms)

💡 Better alternatives:
  • /ctx:research - get fast answers using 3 parallel agents
  • /ctx:plan - create parallel development plans

💬 Haiku suggests: Use '/ctx:research' to quickly investigate React
state libraries in parallel (2 min, ~$0.07). If you want a structured
development plan afterward, follow with '/ctx:plan'.
```

### 🎯 **Smart Intent Detection & Auto-Execution**

Understands natural variations and **automatically executes** the detected command:

- "analyze my code" → Auto-executes `/sc:analyze`
- "review the codebase" → Auto-executes `/sc:analyze`
- "check code quality" → Auto-executes `/sc:analyze`
- "audit for issues" → Auto-executes `/sc:analyze`
- "work on these in parallel" → Auto-executes `/ctx:execute`

### ⚡ **Lightning Fast**

- P95 latency: <2ms (keyword path)
- Zero context overhead
- Lazy model loading
- Automatic caching

### 🔧 **Zero Configuration**

- Works out of the box
- Auto-discovers all installed plugins
- No API keys required (keyword + Model2Vec)
- Optional: Semantic Router for complex queries

---

## Quick Start

### Installation

**Option 1: From Marketplace (Recommended)**

```bash
# Add Promptune marketplace
/plugin marketplace add promptunecc/promptune

# Install plugin
/plugin install promptune
```

**Option 2: Direct from GitHub**

```bash
# Install directly
/plugin install promptunecc/promptune

# Or specify version
/plugin install promptunecc/promptune@0.1.0
```

**Option 3: Local Development**

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/promptune/promptune
cd promptune

# Install locally
/plugin install @local
```

### One-Time Configuration (Recommended)

**NEW in v0.5.0:** Run the configuration command for persistent visibility:

```bash
/ctx:configure
```

This will:

- ✅ Add Promptune section to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (~150 tokens, loaded at session start)
- ✅ Add Promptune commands to your status bar (zero context, always visible)
- ✅ Validate plugin settings and skills
- ✅ Create backups before any changes

**Benefits:**

- **Always visible:** See `/research | /parallel:plan | /parallel:execute` in status bar
- **Session awareness:** Claude remembers Promptune at every session start
- **Safe:** Creates backups, asks permission, provides rollback instructions

**Without configuration:** Promptune still works via intent detection, but you won't see visual reminders.

### Usage

Just type what you want in natural language:

```
# Instead of memorizing:
/sc:analyze --comprehensive

# Just type:
"can you analyze my code for issues?"

# Promptune auto-executes:
🎯 Auto-executing /sc:analyze (85% confidence, keyword match, 0.02ms)
```

### Supported Commands

Promptune detects these commands out of the box:

| Natural Language       | Command            | Confidence |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | ---------- |
| "analyze the code"     | `/sc:analyze`      | 85%        |
| "run tests"            | `/sc:test`         | 85%        |
| "fix this bug"         | `/sc:troubleshoot` | 85%        |
| "implement feature"    | `/sc:implement`    | 85%        |
| "explain this code"    | `/sc:explain`      | 85%        |
| "optimize performance" | `/sc:improve`      | 85%        |
| "design architecture"  | `/sc:design`       | 85%        |
| "commit changes"       | `/sc:git`          | 85%        |

**Expandable:** Promptune auto-discovers commands from all your installed plugins!

---

## Parallel Development Workflow

Promptune includes a powerful parallel development system that lets Claude work on multiple independent tasks simultaneously using git worktrees.

### Key Features

- 🚀 **Automatic Subagent Spawning** - Claude spawns multiple agents to work in parallel
- 🌿 **Git Worktrees** - Isolated working directories for each task
- 📋 **GitHub Integration** - Automatic issue creation and tracking
- 🎯 **Zero Manual Coordination** - Claude manages everything automatically

### Commands

| Natural Language             | Command        | What It Does                                     |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| "plan parallel development"  | `/ctx:plan`    | Document development plan for parallel execution |
| "work on these in parallel"  | `/ctx:execute` | Execute plan in parallel using git worktrees     |
| "check parallel status"      | `/ctx:status`  | Monitor progress across all parallel tasks       |
| "cleanup parallel worktrees" | `/ctx:cleanup` | Clean up completed worktrees and branches        |

### Example Workflow

```
You: "I need to implement authentication, dashboard, and analytics"

Claude: "📋 These tasks are independent. Would you like to work on them in parallel?"

You: "yes, parallelize this work"

Promptune: 🎯 /ctx:execute detected (92% confidence)

Claude:
"✅ Created plan: .parallel/plans/PLAN-20251014.md
✅ Created 3 GitHub issues
✅ Created 3 git worktrees
🚀 Spawning 3 parallel subagents...

Agent 1: Working on authentication (worktrees/task-123)
Agent 2: Working on dashboard (worktrees/task-124)
Agent 3: Working on analytics (worktrees/task-125)

All tasks complete! Measured speedup: 2.1x faster than sequential execution"
```

### Performance & Cost Benefits

**Token Efficiency:**

- Sequential approach: Higher token usage (agents wait for each other)
- Parallel approach: Optimized token usage (concurrent execution)
- Context preservation: Work completes before hitting limits

**Cost Comparison (Haiku Agents):**

- Sequential execution: $0.42 (sum of per-task costs)
- Parallel execution: $0.14 (concurrent, shared setup)
- **Cost savings**: 67% reduction per workflow

**Performance:** Measured speedup typically 1.5-3x on completed workflows (varies by task complexity and dependencies)

**Requirements:**

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Git remote configured
- Clean working tree

## How It Works

### Architecture

```
User prompt: "analyze my code please"
              ↓
    UserPromptSubmit Hook
              ↓
    ┌─────────────────────┐
    │   3-Tier Cascade    │
    ├─────────────────────┤
    │ 1. Keyword (0.02ms) │ → 60% coverage
    │ 2. Model2Vec (0.2ms)│ → 30% coverage
    │ 3. Semantic (50ms)  │ → 10% coverage
    └─────────────────────┘
              ↓
    Command: /sc:analyze (85%)
              ↓
    Hook modifies prompt to "/sc:analyze"
              ↓
    Claude Code auto-executes the command
```

### Confidence Levels

- **85%+**: Keyword match (high precision, instant)
- **70-85%**: Semantic match (good accuracy, fast)
- **50-70%**: Fallback match (requires confirmation)
- **<50%**: No suggestion (pass through)

### 📊 Status Line Integration

**NEW in v0.5.4:** Real-time detection display in your status line!

Promptune now writes detection data that can be displayed in Claude Code's status line, giving you instant visual feedback without consuming context tokens.

**Quick Setup (2 minutes):**

1. **Find the statusline script path:**

   ```bash
   echo "$HOME/.claude/plugins/promptune/statusline.sh"
   ```

2. **Add to your Claude Code statusline config** (`~/.claude/settings.json`):

   ```json
   {
   	"statusline": {
   		"right": [
   			{
   				"type": "command",
   				"command": "/Users/yourname/.claude/plugins/promptune/statusline.sh"
   			}
   		]
   	}
   }
   ```

3. **Or use the automated setup:**
   ```bash
   /ctx:configure
   ```
   This command guides you through the setup process.

**What you'll see:**

- `🎯 /sc:analyze (85% via keyword)` - Command detected
- `🎯 Promptune: Ready` - No active detection
- Detection updates in real-time as you type

**Tip:** Run `/ctx:configure` for guided setup with automatic path detection

**How it works:**

```
UserPromptSubmit Hook
    ↓
Detects intent (keyword/model2vec/semantic)
    ↓
Writes to .promptune/last_detection
    ↓
statusline.sh reads file
    ↓
Status line displays: 🎯 /sc:analyze (85% via keyword)
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Zero context overhead (file-based, not in conversation)
- ✅ Real-time visibility of what Promptune detected
- ✅ See detection method and confidence at a glance
- ✅ Works alongside other status line modules

**Requirements:**

- Bash shell
- `jq` (optional, for pretty formatting)

## FAQ

### Does Promptune slow down Claude Code?

No! The hook adds <2ms latency for 90% of queries. You won't notice it.

### Does it work offline?

Keyword and Model2Vec tiers work completely offline (90% coverage). Semantic Router tier requires an API key but is optional.

### Can I add custom commands?

Yes! Edit `data/user_patterns.json` to add your own mappings.

### Does it work with other plugins?

Yes! Promptune auto-discovers commands from all installed plugins.

### What about privacy?

Everything runs locally except Semantic Router (optional). No data is collected.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No command detected"

- Check confidence threshold in config
- Try more specific language
- Add custom mappings for your phrases

### "Model2Vec not available"

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

The model downloads automatically on first use (~8MB).

### "Semantic Router failing"

```bash
# Set API key
export COHERE_API_KEY="your-key"
# Or
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
```

Or disable in config: `"semantic_router": false`
