They've identified specific issues (seamless handoff, time-based estimation) that need investigation first.\n\n**Why `/ctx:research` + `/ctx:design`:** \n- **Research phase:** Audit documentation gaps, analyze current /ctx:plan and /ctx:execute implementation, inventory all time-based estimates in codebase\n- **Design phase:** Redesign the plan extraction and execution handoff, specify token-based estimation approach, document feature completeness\n\nThis two-phase approach prevents planning work that's based on incomplete understanding of the issues."
