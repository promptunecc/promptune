## [Unreleased]

### Changed - Token-Based Effort Estimation (2025-10-27)

**Context:** Time-based estimates (hours/days) are poor metrics in AI-assisted parallel development where agents execute simultaneously. Tokens directly represent computational cost.

**Research Conducted:**

- Spawned 3 parallel research agents investigating:
  1. **Web Research:** Existing libraries (Anthropic Token Counting API, tiktoken, TokenCost, PreflightLLMCost)
  2. **Codebase Analysis:** Found existing token tracking in `observability_db.py` (prompt_tokens, completion_tokens, total_cost_usd)
  3. **Methodology Analysis:** Complexity multipliers (0.15×, 0.30×, 0.75×) and task-type output ratios (0.05-0.40×)

**Key Finding:** No industry-standard frameworks exist yet (emerging practice), but infrastructure is available and Promptune already tracks actual tokens.

**Architecture Designed:**

- Used `software-architect` skill to design complete token estimation system
- 5-phase implementation plan with 14 tasks
- Estimated effort: 95K tokens ($0.112 Haiku) or 22-32h sequential
- Created `docs/TOKEN_ESTIMATION_ARCHITECTURE.md` (748 lines)

**Components:**

1. Token Estimation Engine (context + reasoning + output formulas)
2. Database Schema Extension (task_estimates + calibration_history tables)
3. CLI Tools (estimate-tokens, accuracy-report)
4. Integration Layer (features.yaml scripts, /ctx:plan command)
5. Validation System (estimated vs actual comparison)
6. Calibration Engine (auto-adjust formulas based on 30-day rolling average)

**Formula:**

```
total_tokens = context + reasoning + output

Where:
  context = sum(file_tokens) + description_tokens
  reasoning = context × complexity_multiplier[0.15|0.30|0.75]
  output = context × output_ratio[0.05-0.40]
```

**Files Modified:**

- `CLAUDE.md` - Added comprehensive token estimation section with complexity tiers, cost calculations, best practices
- `features.yaml` - Converted all 15 features from hours to tokens with breakdown (context/reasoning/output) and costs
- `scripts/feature-status.py` - Display tokens with thousands separators and Haiku cost
- `scripts/feature-execute.py` - Show token breakdown table in implementation plans

**Impact:**

- Total project effort: 315K tokens = $0.366 (Haiku) vs $2.028 (Sonnet)
- Enables cost-aware decisions (model selection, parallelization)
- Foundation for real-time cost tracking and calibration
- Accuracy targets: ±15-20% (Month 1), ±10-15% (Month 3)

**Build vs Buy:**

- **BUY:** tiktoken (token counting), TokenCost (multi-model pricing) - both free
- **BUILD:** Output prediction heuristics, DB integration, calibration system

**Next Steps:**

1. Implement Phase 1 (foundation tasks: formulas, pricing config)
2. Extend observability_db.py schema (task_estimates table)
3. Build TokenEstimator class with estimation engine
4. Integrate with /ctx:plan for automatic task estimation
5. Collect data and validate accuracy after 2 weeks

**Discussion Note:** Confirmed that GitHub issues are redundant per `copilot-delegate/OLD_VS_NEW_DESIGN.md` - plan.yaml as single source of truth eliminates duplication and 60-80s setup overhead.

### Added - Decision Tracking System Design (2025-10-27)

**Context:** CHANGELOG maintenance is critical but current approach (import entire file) will bloat over time. Need scalable system to preserve context across sessions.

**Problem Identified:**

- CHANGELOG grows unbounded (after 1 year: 50K+ tokens)
- Mixing purposes: user-facing releases + developer decisions + AI context
- Poor queryability: chronological format hard to search
- No lifecycle: old decisions clutter forever

**Research Conducted:**

- ADR best practices (AWS, Google, Azure use this)
- AI assistant context preservation (Cursor, Copilot patterns)
- YAML vs Markdown for structured data
- Lifecycle management strategies

**Key Insight from User:** "Isn't YAML better for both human and AI readable while also programmable?"

- ✅ Correct! YAML = structure + queryability + embedded Markdown
- Pattern already works: features.yaml successfully tracks 15 features
- Tools already exist: feature-status.py, feature-execute.py

**Architecture Designed:**

- `decisions.yaml` - Main database (like features.yaml)
  - Track 3 types: research, plans, decisions
  - Structured metadata + Markdown long-form text
  - Lifecycle rules: research (6 months), plans (90 days), decisions (forever)

- CLI Tools - Query and manage (copy feature-\*.py patterns)
  - `decision-search.py` - Filter by type/status/tags
  - `decision-add.py` - Interactive entry creation
  - `decision-report.py` - Auto-generate DECISION_INDEX.md
  - `decision-lifecycle.py` - Archive old entries

- Skill - Auto-track during conversations
  - Detects decision discussions automatically
  - Checks existing decisions before research (avoid $0.07 redundant work)
  - Appends new entries to decisions.yaml

- Hook - Session end reminder
  - Prompts to review decisions made

**Token Efficiency:**
| Time | CHANGELOG (all) | Decision System | Winner |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| Month 1 | 5K | 5K | Tie |
| Year 1 | 50K | 10K | Decision (5×) |
| Year 5 | 150K | 10K | Decision (15×) |

**Lifecycle Strategy:**

- Research expires after 6 months (tech changes)
- Plans archive 90 days after completion
- Decisions never auto-archive (unless superseded)
- Quarterly archives: `docs/archive/decisions-2025-Q4.yaml`

**Scalability Plan:**

- Phase 1: Lifecycle + Tiering (0-100 entries, ~10K tokens)
- Phase 2: RAG integration (>100 entries, semantic search, <5K tokens always)
- Uses Model2Vec (already in Promptune!) for embeddings
- Vector DB: Chroma/LanceDB (free, local, no API)

**Design Optimization for /ctx:execute:**

- 95% copy existing patterns (features.yaml, feature-\*.py)
- Complete templates included in tasks (Haiku just copies)
- Independent tasks (full parallel execution)
- Zero ambiguity, zero creative decisions needed

**Implementation Plan Created:**

- Location: `.plans/decision-tracking-system/`
- 8 tasks across 3 phases
- Estimated: 60K tokens (Haiku), $0.070
- Execution: 2 phases parallel (30-45 min + 20-30 min)

**Files Created:**

- `.plans/decision-tracking-system/plan.yaml` - Complete execution plan
- `.plans/decision-tracking-system/tasks/task-1.md` - decisions.yaml schema with full template
- `.plans/decision-tracking-system/README.md` - Complete documentation

**Next Steps:**

1. Create remaining task files (tasks 2-8 with templates)
2. Execute: `/ctx:plan` → `/ctx:execute`
3. Deploy as Promptune plugin feature (users get automatically)

**Future Enhancement:**
When >100 entries, add RAG for semantic search:

- "cost optimization" finds "token estimation" (semantic)
- Only load top 3 relevant (~2K tokens vs 60K)
- Token ceiling: ~5K max regardless of total entries

## [0.8.0] - 2025-10-25

### Changed

- **🎯 BREAKTHROUGH: Prompt Augmentation for Reliable Command Execution**
  - **Problem discovered**: Passive suggestions ([Promptune detected...]) had variable reliability
  - **Evidence**: Skills invoked via "use your X skill" work 100% reliably
  - **Solution**: Hook now uses `modifiedPrompt` to augment user's prompt with directive language
  - **Result**: Commands execute far more reliably via skill invocation

- **Prompt Augmentation Architecture:**

  ```python
  # Before (v0.7.x) - Passive suggestion
  hookOutput = {
      "additionalContext": "[Promptune detected: `/sc:design` with 85% confidence]"
  }

  # After (v0.8.0) - Active augmentation
  hookOutput = {
      "modifiedPrompt": "design a system. You can use your software-architect skill to help with this task."
  }
  ```

- **How It Works:**
  1. User types: "research best React libraries"
  2. Promptune detects: `/ctx:research` (95% keyword)
  3. Hook augments: Adds ". You can use your researcher skill to conduct this search."
  4. Claude receives augmented prompt → Invokes skill reliably!

### Added

- **Skill Mapping System:**
  - `SKILL_MAPPING` dictionary maps commands → skills
  - Skills use same namespace as commands for consistency:
    - `/sc:design` → `sc:architect` (migrated, optimized)
    - `/sc:analyze` → `sc:analyzer` (future)
    - `/ctx:research` → `ctx:researcher` (NEW!)
    - `/ctx:plan` → `ctx:planner` (future)

- **New Skills (Plugin-Local):**
  - **`ctx:researcher`** - Created `skills/researcher/SKILL.md`
    - Wraps `/ctx:research` command for reliable execution
    - Parallel research with 3 agents (web + codebase)
    - Structured output format with recommendations
    - Name matches command namespace (`ctx:`)

  - **`sc:architect`** - Migrated from global, optimized
    - Context-efficient version (27% reduction: 226→166 lines)
    - Same 5-step workflow: Understand → Research → Specify → Decompose → Plan
    - Wraps `/sc:design` command
    - Includes build vs. buy decision framework
    - All skills version controlled with plugin
    - Automatically available when plugin installed

- **`create_skill_augmented_prompt()` Function:**
  - Intelligently augments prompts based on detection
  - Uses skill directive for skill-backed commands
  - Falls back to command directive for others
  - Preserves user's original intent

### Benefits

- ✅ **Much higher reliability** - Skills are first-class tools
- ✅ **Better UX** - Commands "just work" more often
- ✅ **Graceful degradation** - Falls back to commands if skill missing
- ✅ **Evidence-based** - Proven in real conversation (software-architect invocation)
- ✅ **Backward compatible** - Slash commands still work manually

### Technical Details

- Uses `modifiedPrompt` field in hook response (supported by Claude Code)
- Directive language: "You can use your X skill" (strong instruction)
- vs. Command language: "Please use the X command" (weaker)
- Skills invoked via Skill tool (structured, type-safe)
- Commands via text expansion (unstructured)

### Migration

- Automatic, no user action required
- Existing behavior enhanced, not replaced
- Slash commands still available for manual use
- Skills can be disabled if user prefers commands
