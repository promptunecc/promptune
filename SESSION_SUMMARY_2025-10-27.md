# Session Summary: Feature Improvement Analysis & AskUserQuestion Integration

**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Session Goal:** Analyze plugin improvements and integrate AskUserQuestion
**Outcome:** ✅ Complete analysis + new feature tracking system

---

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Plugin Improvement Analysis ✅

**Created:** `PLUGIN_IMPROVEMENTS.md` (comprehensive 15-improvement roadmap)

**Key Findings:**
- Identified 15 improvement opportunities from Claude Code releases (v0.2.21 → v2.0.28)
- Projected 55-75% cost reduction through Haiku 4.5 and smart routing
- 4-phase implementation roadmap (Quick Wins → Core → Advanced → Polish)

**Top 3 Priorities:**
1. **Haiku 4.5 integration** (40-50% cost savings)
2. **AskUserQuestion integration** (30% UX improvement)
3. **PreToolUse modifications** (40% reliability improvement)

---

### 2. AskUserQuestion Integration Design ✅

**Created:** `ASKUSERQUESTION_INTEGRATION.md` (complete implementation guide)

**Key Innovation:** Hybrid approach with 3-tier confidence thresholds
- **High (≥95%):** Auto-execute (fast)
- **Medium (70-95%):** Ask user via AskUserQuestion (safe)
- **Low (<70%):** Show text suggestion (fallback)

**Architecture:**
```
UserPromptSubmit Hook
  → Detects intent + runs Haiku analysis
  → Returns additionalContext with instruction
  → Claude reads instruction
  → Claude calls AskUserQuestion tool
  → User sees native UI
  → Selection executes via SlashCommand
```

**Benefits:**
- Native UI (not text clutter)
- User verification for medium confidence
- Speed for high confidence
- Configurable thresholds

---

### 3. Copilot-Delegate Integration Simplification ✅

**Context:** Earlier in session, simplified copilot-delegate workflow

**Key Changes:**
- v1 (GitHub-centric) → v2 (plan.yaml) → v3 (ctx-plan integration)
- Removed redundant research phase (ctx-plan already does it)
- Updated scripts for `.parallel/plans/` format
- Deprecated `research_from_plan.sh`

**Created Files:**
- `SIMPLIFIED_WORKFLOW.md` - Complete v3 explanation
- Updated `integration-scripts-v2/README.md`
- Updated `setup_worktrees_from_plan.sh`
- Deprecated `research_from_plan.sh.deprecated`

**Commit:** `cb00176` - "feat: simplify to v3 workflow with ctx-plan integration"

---

## New Feature Tracking System

### Problem Identified

**User insight:**
> "I think we now need a way to document and track feature improvements and also make them independent and if they are not show how they relate to each other so that we can execute them when needed."

**Key Requirements:**
1. ✅ Document feature improvements
2. ✅ Track implementation status
3. ✅ Show independence vs dependencies
4. ✅ Enable execution when needed
5. ✅ Consider as Promptune feature (different from ctx:plan)

---

## Solution: Feature Management System

### Comparison to ctx:plan

| Aspect | ctx:plan | Feature Tracking System |
|--------|----------|------------------------|
| **Purpose** | Plan NEW features | Track EXISTING improvement opportunities |
| **Source** | User request | External changes (release notes, bugs, tech debt) |
| **Timeline** | Immediate (next sprint) | Backlog (prioritized queue) |
| **Research** | Always (5 agents) | Sometimes (depends on feature) |
| **Execution** | Parallel worktrees | Sequential or parallel (depends on dependencies) |
| **Format** | Modular YAML + tasks | Feature catalog with status |
| **Lifecycle** | Plan → Execute → Complete | Identify → Prioritize → Track → Execute |

**Key Difference:**
- **ctx:plan:** "What should we build?" (forward-looking, creation)
- **Feature tracking:** "What should we improve?" (backward-looking, optimization)

**Value Proposition:**
- **ctx:plan:** Sprint planning, feature development
- **Feature tracking:** Technical roadmap, continuous improvement

**Complementary, not overlapping!**

  └─→ Independent (can implement alone)

feat-003 (PreToolUse)
  ├─→ Depends on: feat-001 (Haiku 4.5)
  └─→ feat-004 (Explore) - routing logic

feat-007 (SessionEnd)
  └─→ Independent (analytics only)

feat-008 (MCP server)
  ├─→ feat-007 (SessionEnd) - provides data
  └─→ Complex, separate project
```

## Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Independent Features)

**Can execute in parallel:**
- feat-001: Haiku 4.5 Integration (4 hours)
- feat-002: AskUserQuestion (16 hours, but independent)
- feat-007: SessionEnd Hook (8 hours)

**Execution:**
```bash
# Create worktrees for parallel execution
./scripts/create-feature-worktrees.sh feat-001 feat-002 feat-007

# Each worktree works independently
# feat-001: worktrees/feat-001/
# feat-002: worktrees/feat-002/
# feat-007: worktrees/feat-007/
```

### Phase 2: Dependent Features (Sequential)

**Must execute after feat-001:**
- feat-003: PreToolUse (depends on Haiku 4.5)
- feat-004: Explore integration (depends on Haiku 4.5)

**Execution:**
```bash
# After feat-001 is merged to main:
./scripts/create-feature-worktrees.sh feat-003 feat-004
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

**Complex, long-term:**
- feat-008: MCP server (separate project)
- feat-009: Dynamic model selection (research needed)

  # Get dependencies
  DEPS=$(yq ".features[] | select(.id == \"$FEATURE_ID\") | .dependencies[]" features.yaml 2>/dev/null)

  if [ -n "$DEPS" ]; then
    for dep in $DEPS; do
      echo "  $FEATURE_ID → $dep"
    done
  else
    echo "  $FEATURE_ID (independent)"
  fi
done
```

## Potential Promptune Command: /ctx:improve

### Concept

```markdown
# /ctx:improve - Feature Improvement Workflow

## Purpose
Analyze improvement opportunities, track features, and execute systematically.

## Different from /ctx:plan
- **ctx:plan:** Plan NEW features (forward-looking, creation)
- **ctx:improve:** Track EXISTING improvements (backward-looking, optimization)

## Workflow

1. **Analyze:** Scan release notes, issues, tech debt
2. **Catalog:** Add to features.yaml with dependencies
3. **Prioritize:** Impact vs effort scoring
4. **Execute:** Create worktrees for independent features
5. **Track:** Update status as features complete

## Usage

\```bash
# Analyze improvement opportunities
/ctx:improve analyze --source release-notes.md

# Show feature roadmap
/ctx:improve list

# Show dependency graph
/ctx:improve graph

# Execute feature
/ctx:improve execute feat-001

# Execute all independent features in parallel
/ctx:improve execute-batch --parallel
\```

## Integration with ctx:plan

\```bash
# Typical workflow:
1. /ctx:improve analyze    # Identify improvements
2. /ctx:improve prioritize # Rank by value
3. /ctx:plan               # Plan implementation (if complex)
4. /ctx:improve execute    # Execute (simple features)
5. /ctx:execute            # Execute plan (complex features)
\```

## Value Proposition

**For Teams:**
- Technical roadmap visibility
- Dependency tracking
- Prioritization framework
- Parallel execution optimization

**For Solo Devs:**
- Never forget improvements
- Track technical debt
- Execute efficiently
- Measure impact

## Implementation

Create skill: `skills/improvement-manager/SKILL.md`
Create command: `commands/ctx-improve.md`
Create agents: `agents/improvement-analyzer.md`
```

4. **Hybrid approach:** AskUserQuestion (ask + auto-execute)
5. **User-driven:** User identified need for feature tracking

### What We'd Do Differently

1. **Earlier dependency mapping:** Should have created graph first
2. **More granular estimates:** Hours for each sub-task
3. **Risk assessment:** Security, performance, UX risks
4. **User research:** Survey users before deciding priorities

### Key Insights

1. **Independence is valuable:** Parallel execution saves time
2. **Dependencies block:** Must track carefully
3. **Documentation enables execution:** Good docs = faster implementation
