# Promptune Skills - Autonomous Expert Guidance

**Version:** 0.5.4
**Status:** ✅ Experimental (0.x)

Promptune now includes **AI-powered Skills** that provide autonomous expert guidance. Skills are **model-invoked** - Claude automatically activates them when you need help, no commands required!

---

## 🎯 What Are Skills?

Skills are specialized capabilities that Claude autonomously uses based on your requests. Unlike slash commands (which you invoke explicitly), Skills activate automatically when Claude detects you need expert help.

**Key Difference:**

```
Slash Commands: User-invoked
  You: "/promptune:execute"
  Claude: Executes the command

Skills: Model-invoked
  You: "How can I speed up development?"
  Claude: *Automatically activates parallel-development-expert skill*
          "Let me analyze your project for parallelization opportunities..."
```

---

## 📦 Available Skills

## 🚀 How to Use Skills

### The Magic: You Don't Need To!

Skills activate automatically when Claude detects you need them. Just talk naturally:

```
❌ Don't: "Activate the parallel-development-expert skill"
✅ Do: "Can you help me work on multiple features faster?"

❌ Don't: "Use git-worktree-master to fix this error"
✅ Do: "I'm getting a worktree locked error"

❌ Don't: "Run performance-optimizer analysis"
✅ Do: "Why is my parallel workflow so slow?"
```

### Natural Language Examples

**Parallel Development:**
```
"I need to build 5 features - can we do them in parallel?"
"How do I work on multiple tasks simultaneously?"
"Speed up development by parallelizing work"
"Work on auth and dashboard at the same time"
```

**Discovery:**
```
"What can I do with Promptune?"
"Show me what's possible"
"How does this work?"
"Give me some examples"
```

**Troubleshooting:**
```
"I can't remove this worktree"
"Getting a locked error"
"How do I clean up old worktrees?"
"Git worktree issues"
```

**Performance:**
```
"Why is this slow?"
"Can I make parallel execution faster?"
"Analyze my workflow performance"
"How much time am I saving?"
```

## 🔧 Skill Integration

Skills work together seamlessly:

```
Scenario: "I want to work on 10 features in parallel but I'm getting worktree errors"

1. parallel-development-expert activates first:
   "Great! 10 features is ambitious. Let me analyze..."

2. Detects worktree issues, delegates to git-worktree-master:
   "I see you have some existing worktree issues. Let me diagnose..."

3. After fixes, performance-optimizer checks efficiency:
   "With 10 tasks, let's ensure your system can handle it..."

Result: Coordinated expert guidance from multiple skills!
```

## 🔬 Advanced Usage

### Skill Descriptions (for developers)

Each skill has a carefully crafted description that helps Claude decide when to use it:

**parallel-development-expert:**
```yaml
description: Expert guidance on parallel development workflows using git worktrees
             and multi-agent execution. Use when users mention parallel work,
             concurrent development, speeding up development, working on multiple
             features simultaneously, or scaling team productivity.
```

**intent-recognition:**
```yaml
description: Help users discover Promptune capabilities and understand how to use
             natural language commands. Use when users ask about Promptune features,
             available commands, how to use the plugin, or what they can do.
```

### Tool Access Restrictions

Skills have controlled tool access for safety:

```yaml
# Example: git-worktree-master
allowed-tools:
  - Bash      # For git commands
  - Read      # For diagnostics
  - Grep      # For analysis
  # NO Write/Edit tools (read-only for safety)
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Skills don't activate"

**Check:**
1. Are you using natural language? (Not slash commands)
2. Is your description close to skill triggers?
3. Try being more specific: "How can I work on multiple features in parallel?"

### "Wrong skill activates"

**Fix:**
Be more specific in your question:
```
❌ Vague: "Help with parallel work"
✅ Specific: "I'm getting worktree errors during parallel work"
   (Activates git-worktree-master, not parallel-development-expert)
```

### "Want to see which skill is active"

Skills will often announce themselves:
```
Claude: "Let me analyze your parallel workflow..." (performance-optimizer)
Claude: "Let me diagnose that worktree error..." (git-worktree-master)
```
