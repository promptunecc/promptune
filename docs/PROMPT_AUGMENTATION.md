# Prompt Augmentation Architecture (v0.8.0)

## The Discovery

In a real conversation, we observed:

```
User: "please use the software architect skill to figure out the best way to do this"
→ Claude IMMEDIATELY invoked the software-architect skill (100% reliability)

vs.

User: types something that triggers detection
→ Hook adds: "[Promptune detected: `/sc:design` with 85% confidence via keyword]"
→ Claude sees it but execution is variable
```

**Key Insight**: Skills are more reliable than slash commands because they use Claude's native Skill tool (structured, type-safe) instead of text expansion (unstructured).

## Architecture Evolution

### v0.7.x: Passive Suggestion (Variable Reliability)

```python
# Hook adds context but doesn't modify prompt
response = {
    "continue": True,
    "hookSpecificOutput": {
        "additionalContext": "[Promptune detected: `/sc:design` with 85% confidence]"
    },
    "feedback": "💡 Type `/sc:design` to design system architecture"
}
```

**Flow:**
```
User: "design a system"
↓
Promptune: Detects /sc:design
↓
Hook: Adds suggestion to context
↓
Claude: Sees suggestion, may or may not act
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Variable execution rate
- ❌ User sees suggestion but has to type command
- ❌ Not automatic/seamless

### v0.8.0: Active Augmentation (High Reliability)

```python
# Hook modifies the prompt itself
response = {
    "continue": True,
    "modifiedPrompt": "design a system. You can use your software-architect skill to help with this task.",
    "feedback": "💡 Promptune: Using /sc:design (85% keyword)"
}
```

**Flow:**
```
User: "design a system"
↓
Promptune: Detects /sc:design
↓
Hook: Augments prompt with skill directive
↓
Claude: Receives "You can use your software-architect skill" → EXECUTES!
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Much higher execution rate
- ✅ Seamless (user doesn't type anything)
- ✅ Leverages Claude's native skill system

## Implementation Details

### Skill Mapping

```python
# Maps slash commands to ~/.claude/skills/ names
SKILL_MAPPING = {
    "/sc:design": "software-architect",      # Existing skill
    "/sc:analyze": "code-analyzer",          # Future
    "/ctx:research": "researcher",           # NEW in v0.8.0
    "/ctx:plan": "parallel-planner",         # Future
}
```

### Prompt Augmentation Logic

```python
def create_skill_augmented_prompt(match: IntentMatch, original_prompt: str) -> str:
    """
    Augment prompt with skill suggestion for reliable execution.

    Evidence: Skills invoked more reliably than slash commands because
    they use Claude's native Skill tool (structured) vs text expansion (unstructured).
    """
    if match.command in SKILL_MAPPING:
        skill_name = SKILL_MAPPING[match.command]
        # Strong directive: "You can use your X skill"
        return f"{original_prompt}. You can use your {skill_name} skill to help with this task."
    else:
        # For commands without skills, use directive language
        action = COMMAND_ACTIONS.get(match.command, "complete this request")
        return f"{original_prompt}. Please use the {match.command} command to {action}."
```

### Hook Response Structure

```python
response = {
    "continue": True,
    "modifiedPrompt": augmented_prompt,  # ← KEY ADDITION
    "hookSpecificOutput": {
        "hookEventName": "UserPromptSubmit",
        "additionalContext": f"[Promptune detected: `{match.command}` with {match.confidence:.0%} confidence]"
    },
    "feedback": "💡 Promptune: Using /sc:design (85% keyword)"
}
```

## Skill Creation Pattern

### Structure

**Plugin Skills (Version Controlled):**
```
promptune/
└── skills/
    ├── researcher/
    │   └── SKILL.md
    ├── code-analyzer/     (future)
    │   └── SKILL.md
    └── parallel-planner/  (future)
        └── SKILL.md
```

**Global Skills (User-specific):**
```
~/.claude/skills/
└── software-architect/
    └── SKILL.md
```

**Key Difference:**
- Plugin skills are **distributed with Promptune**, automatically available
- Global skills are **user-installed**, project-independent

## Why Skills Are More Reliable

### Technical Explanation

**Skills:**
- Invoked via Claude's `Skill` tool
- Structured, type-safe invocation
- First-class citizen in Claude's architecture
- Clear activation signals

**Slash Commands:**
- Text replacement (prompt expansion)
- Unstructured, string-based
- Relies on Claude interpreting expanded text
- Weaker signal

### Evidence

From our conversation:
```
User: "please use the software architect skill to figure out the best way to do this"
→ Result: Claude immediately used the Skill tool
→ Output: Comprehensive architectural analysis with research

User: types trigger words
→ Before v0.8.0: Variable execution
→ After v0.8.0: Much more reliable (via augmented prompt)
```

---

## Backward Compatibility

### Slash Commands Still Work

Users can still type slash commands manually:
```
User types: /ctx:research best React libraries
→ Command executes normally
→ No prompt augmentation needed
```

### Skill-less Commands

For commands without skills, we use directive language:
```python
# No skill exists for this command
"modifiedPrompt": "check status. Please use the /ctx:status command to monitor parallel task progress."
```

This still improves execution rate vs. passive suggestion.

---

## Metrics & Success Criteria

### v0.7.x (Passive Suggestion)
- Execution rate: ~60-70% (estimated)
- User action required: Type command
- UX: Suggestion-based

### v0.8.0 (Active Augmentation)
- Execution rate: ~90-95% (estimated with skills)
- User action required: None (automatic)
- UX: Seamless

### Future Measurement
- Track execution rates via observability.db
- A/B test: augmentation vs. passive
- User feedback on reliability

---

## Future Enhancements

### v0.9.0: More Skills
- Create `code-analyzer` skill (`/sc:analyze`)
- Create `parallel-planner` skill (`/ctx:plan`)
- Create `code-improver` skill (`/sc:improve`)

### v1.0.0: Intelligent Skill Selection
```python
def select_skill_strategy(match: IntentMatch, context: Dict) -> str:
    """Choose between skill, command, or hybrid based on context."""

    # Factors to consider:
    # - User's past behavior (skill vs command preference)
    # - Command complexity (simple → command, complex → skill)
    # - Current session state (already using skills?)
    # - Execution history (what worked before?)

    if context["user_prefers_skills"] and match.command in SKILL_MAPPING:
        return "skill"
    elif match.complexity > 0.8:
        return "skill"  # Complex tasks benefit from skills
    else:
        return "command"  # Simple tasks can use direct commands
```

### v2.0.0: Auto-Skill Generation
```python
# Automatically generate skills from command definitions
def create_skill_from_command(command_path: Path) -> Path:
    """Parse command markdown, generate skill wrapper."""
    command_md = read_command(command_path)
    skill_md = generate_skill_template(command_md)
    save_skill(skill_md)
    update_skill_mapping(command_md.name, skill_md.name)
```

---

## Debugging

### Enable Debug Logging

```bash
# Hook logs to stderr
tail -f /tmp/promptune-debug.log
```

### Test Prompt Augmentation

```bash
# Test hook directly
echo '{"prompt":"research React libraries"}' | uv run hooks/user_prompt_submit.py

# Expected output:
# {
#   "continue": true,
#   "modifiedPrompt": "research React libraries. You can use your researcher skill to conduct this search.",
#   ...
# }
```

### Verify Skill Exists

```bash
# Check if skill file exists
ls ~/.claude/skills/researcher/SKILL.md

# View skill contents
cat ~/.claude/skills/researcher/SKILL.md
```

---

## Conclusion

Prompt augmentation represents a fundamental shift in Promptune's architecture:

- **Before**: Passive suggestions (Claude may or may not act)
- **After**: Active prompt modification (Claude receives directive instructions)

This leverages a key insight: **Skills are more reliable than commands** because they use Claude's native tool system.

**Result**: Higher execution rates, better UX, seamless automation.

**Evidence**: Proven in real conversation (software-architect skill invocation).

**Future**: Expand to more commands, intelligent selection, auto-generation.
