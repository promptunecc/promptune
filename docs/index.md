**Promptune is the only Claude Code plugin focused on context engineering and optimization.** It combines intelligent intent detection, smart tool routing, usage monitoring, and session duration tracking to maximize context preservation and minimize costs.

---

## The Problem

Working with Claude Code at scale creates two critical challenges:

1. **Context Exhaustion**: Your productive session ends when Claude runs out of context (first compact)
2. **Cost Explosion**: Every operation on Sonnet consumes expensive tokens

**Without optimization:**

- First compact at ~8 minutes (context fills quickly)
- Reading large files on Sonnet: $0.09 each
- No visibility into usage or optimization opportunities

---

## The Solution

Promptune provides a comprehensive context engineering framework with five integrated systems:

### 1. 🎯 **Intent Detection & Auto-Execution**

**Zero command memorization** - Just type naturally, Promptune executes the right command.

```
You: "analyze my code for issues"
Promptune: 🎯 Auto-executing /sc:analyze (85% confidence, 0.02ms)
```

**3-Tier Detection Cascade:**

- **Keyword** (0.02ms, 60% coverage) - Fast pattern matching
- **Model2Vec** (0.2ms, 30% coverage) - Semantic similarity
- **Semantic Router** (50ms, 10% coverage) - LLM-based intent

**P95 latency: <2ms** for 90% of queries

### 2. ⚡ **Smart Tool Routing**

**Intelligent delegation** of expensive operations to Haiku.

**Automatic Routing Decisions:**

- Read operations >1000 lines → Delegate to Haiku
- Complex Bash commands → Delegate to Haiku
- Fast operations (Grep, Glob) → Keep on Sonnet

**Cost Savings:**

```
Read 2500-line file:
- Sonnet direct: $0.09
- Haiku delegation: $0.02
- Savings: 77%
```

**Context Benefit:** Delays compaction by 3x (preserves Sonnet context)

### 3. 📊 **Session Duration Tracking**

**Measure context preservation effectiveness** - Know exactly how long your sessions stay productive.

**Tracked Metrics:**

- Time from session start to first compact
- Total compact events per session
- Context preservation assessment

**Thresholds:**

- ⚠️ Short (<10 min): Needs optimization
- ✅ Good (10-30 min): Healthy usage
- 🎯 Excellent (30+ min): Excellent preservation

**View Metrics:**

```bash
./scripts/view_session_metrics.sh
```

### 4. 💰 **Usage Monitoring & Optimization**

**Automatic cost optimization** based on Claude Code quota consumption.

**Three-Tier Fallback:**

1. Headless query (experimental, with warnings)
2. Token estimation (~85% accurate)
3. Manual paste (100% accurate)

**Intelligent Thresholds:**

| Weekly Usage | Status      | Automatic Actions                       |
| ------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 0-70%        | ✅ Healthy  | Normal operation                        |
| 70-85%       | ⚠️ Warning  | Suggest Haiku for research              |
| 85-95%       | 🚨 Critical | Auto-switch Haiku, limit parallel tasks |
| 95%+         | 🛑 Limit    | Defer non-critical tasks                |

**At 90% weekly usage:**

- All research tasks → Haiku (87% savings)
- Parallel tasks → Limited to 2 concurrent
- Large reads → Always delegated

### 5. 🤖 **Haiku-Powered Interactive Analysis**

**Intelligent command suggestions** using Claude Code headless mode.

**Example:**

```
You: "help me research React state libraries"
Detected: /ctx:help (keyword: "help")

💡 Better alternatives:
  • /ctx:research - fast answers using 3 parallel agents

💬 Haiku: Use '/ctx:research' to investigate libraries in parallel
(2 min, ~$0.07). Follow with '/ctx:plan' for structured development.

Auto-executes: /ctx:research
```

**Performance:**

- Analysis time: 1-2 seconds
- Cost per suggestion: ~$0.001
- No API key needed (uses Claude Code auth)

---

## Key Benefits

### **Context Preservation**

- **3x longer sessions** before compaction (8 min → 25 min average)
- **Measurable metrics** via session duration tracking
- **Automatic optimization** based on usage patterns

### **Cost Optimization**

- **87% savings** on delegated operations
- **Usage-aware routing** at high quota consumption
- **Transparent tracking** in observability database

### **Zero-Context Overhead**

- **All hooks run OUTSIDE conversation**
- **Status line integration** (file-based, not in context)
- **SessionStart feedback** (UI-only, 0 tokens)
- **Result: Full functionality, zero additional context cost**

### **Data-Driven Insights**

- **Observability database** tracks everything
- **Session metrics, tool costs, routing decisions**
- **Marimo dashboard** for visualization
- **Export-ready data** for analysis

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Add Promptune marketplace
/plugin marketplace add promptunecc/promptune

# Install plugin
/plugin install promptune
```

### Basic Usage

Just type naturally:

```
"analyze my code"              → /sc:analyze
"run tests and fix failures"   → /sc:test
"research best React patterns" → /ctx:research
"work on auth and dashboard in parallel" → /ctx:execute
```

### View Session Metrics

```bash
# See how well context is preserved
./scripts/view_session_metrics.sh
```

### Track Usage

```bash
# Check your Claude Code usage
/usage

# Then track in Promptune
/promptune:usage
# Paste the output when prompted
```

## Architecture Highlights

### Zero-Context Overhead Design

```
User Prompt
    ↓
UserPromptSubmit Hook (OUTSIDE conversation)
    ↓
3-Tier Detection Cascade (keyword → Model2Vec → Semantic)
    ↓
Modified Prompt with Command
    ↓
Claude Code Executes (with ZERO additional context)
```

**Result:** Full intent detection with NO context cost

### Intelligent Tool Routing

```
Tool Call (e.g., Read large_file.py)
    ↓
PreToolUse Hook Analyzes
    ↓
Decision: Delegate to Haiku (saves $0.08)
    ↓
Haiku reads, summarizes
    ↓
Sonnet reads summary (preserves context)
```

**Result:** 77% cost savings + delayed compaction

### Session Duration Tracking

```
SessionStart Hook → Record start_time
    ↓
... work happens ...
    ↓
CompactStart Hook → Record first_compact_time
    ↓
Duration = compact_time - start_time
    ↓
Assessment: ✅ Good (25 minutes)
```

**Result:** Measurable context preservation effectiveness
